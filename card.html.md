### Card

>      Card (suit=0, rank=2)

*Represents a standard playing card.*

### Creating Cards

[`Card`](https://shadisharba.github.io/python_swak/card.html#card) is a
class that represents a single card in a deck of cards. We can create
cards like this:

``` python
c = Card(suit=1, rank=3)
c
```

    3♦️

In these docs we’ll generally show the expected output from our code
like so:

``` python
test_eq(str(c), '3♦️')
```

``` python
c2 = Card(suit=2, rank=11)
test_eq(str(c2), 'J❤️')
```

<div>

> **Tip**
>
> **These `test_eq` statements are not just documentation, they are also
> unit tests!** These cells will get tested automatically with continous
> integration. You can also run tests locally with the command
> `nbdev_test`. If you do not want to show a test in your docs, you can
> choose to hide cells with the `#|hide` directive.

</div>

### Comparing Cards

You can also compare cards like so:

``` python
test_eq(c2 > c, True)
```
